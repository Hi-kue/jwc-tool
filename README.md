## Introduction

JWC-Tool is just a simple command-line tool that follows a challenge from the website [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges).
The tool is designed to be a wc tool that can be used to count the number of lines in a file, the number of words in a file,

systems, this tool is designed to be for my own learning purposes.
